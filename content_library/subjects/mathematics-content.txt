# MATHEMATICS - Complete Learning Guide

## Chapter 1: Number System

**Natural Numbers**
Natural numbers are counting numbers starting from 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.
These are the first numbers we learn to count with.
Examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...

**Whole Numbers**  
Whole numbers include all natural numbers plus zero.
Set of whole numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...
Zero is the smallest whole number.

**Integers**
Integers include positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero.
Examples: ...-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3...
Positive integers: 1, 2, 3, 4...
Negative integers: -1, -2, -3, -4...

**Rational Numbers**
Rational numbers can be expressed as fractions where denominator is not zero.
Examples: 1/2, 3/4, -2/5, 0.5, 0.75
Every integer is also a rational number.

**Irrational Numbers**
Numbers that cannot be expressed as fractions.
Examples: π (pi), √2, √3, e
These have non-terminating, non-repeating decimal expansions.

## Chapter 2: Basic Operations

**Addition**
Addition means combining two or more numbers to get their sum.
Symbol: + (plus sign)
Example: 5 + 3 = 8
Properties:
- Commutative: a + b = b + a
- Associative: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
- Identity: a + 0 = a

**Subtraction**
Subtraction means finding the difference between two numbers.
Symbol: - (minus sign)
Example: 8 - 3 = 5
Subtraction is the inverse operation of addition.

**Multiplication**
Multiplication is repeated addition or finding the product of numbers.
Symbol: × or * (times sign)
Example: 4 × 3 = 12 (which is 4 + 4 + 4)
Properties:
- Commutative: a × b = b × a
- Associative: (a × b) × c = a × (b × c)
- Identity: a × 1 = a
- Zero property: a × 0 = 0

**Division**
Division is splitting a number into equal parts.
Symbol: ÷ or / (division sign)
Example: 12 ÷ 3 = 4
Division is the inverse operation of multiplication.

## Chapter 3: BODMAS Rule

**Order of Operations**
BODMAS stands for:
- **B**rackets
- **O**rders (powers and roots)
- **D**ivision
- **M**ultiplication
- **A**ddition
- **S**ubtraction

**How to Use BODMAS**
1. First solve operations inside Brackets ( )
2. Then solve Orders (powers like 2², roots like √9)
3. Then solve Division and Multiplication from left to right
4. Finally solve Addition and Subtraction from left to right

**Example:**
Solve: 2 + 3 × 4 - 1
Step 1: No brackets or orders
Step 2: Multiplication first: 3 × 4 = 12
Step 3: Now we have: 2 + 12 - 1
Step 4: Left to right: 2 + 12 = 14, then 14 - 1 = 13
Answer: 13

## Chapter 4: Fractions

**What is a Fraction?**
A fraction represents part of a whole.
Written as numerator/denominator
Example: 3/4 means 3 parts out of 4 equal parts

**Types of Fractions**
- **Proper fraction**: Numerator < Denominator (3/5, 2/7)
- **Improper fraction**: Numerator ≥ Denominator (7/5, 8/3)
- **Mixed number**: Whole number + proper fraction (2 1/3, 1 3/4)

**Adding Fractions**
- **Like fractions** (same denominator): Add numerators, keep denominator
  Example: 2/7 + 3/7 = 5/7
- **Unlike fractions** (different denominators): Find common denominator first
  Example: 1/3 + 1/4 = 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12

**Subtracting Fractions**
Follow same rules as addition but subtract numerators.
Example: 5/6 - 2/6 = 3/6 = 1/2

**Multiplying Fractions**
Multiply numerators together and denominators together.
Example: 2/3 × 3/4 = 6/12 = 1/2

**Dividing Fractions**
Multiply by the reciprocal of the second fraction.
Example: 2/3 ÷ 1/4 = 2/3 × 4/1 = 8/3

## Chapter 5: Decimals

**Understanding Decimals**
Decimals use place value system with decimal point.
Place values after decimal: tenths, hundredths, thousandths

**Example: 25.347**
- 2 is in tens place
- 5 is in ones place
- 3 is in tenths place
- 4 is in hundredths place
- 7 is in thousandths place

**Converting Fractions to Decimals**
Divide numerator by denominator.
Example: 3/4 = 3 ÷ 4 = 0.75

**Adding and Subtracting Decimals**
Align decimal points vertically.
Example:
  25.6
+ 13.47
-------
  39.07

**Multiplying Decimals**
1. Multiply as if they were whole numbers
2. Count total decimal places in both numbers
3. Place decimal point in answer

Example: 2.5 × 1.3
25 × 13 = 325
Total decimal places: 1 + 1 = 2
Answer: 3.25

## Chapter 6: Percentages

**What is Percentage?**
Percent means "per hundred" or "out of 100"
Symbol: %
Example: 25% = 25/100 = 0.25

**Converting Between Forms**
- Fraction to percentage: Multiply by 100
  Example: 3/4 = (3/4) × 100 = 75%
- Percentage to fraction: Divide by 100
  Example: 40% = 40/100 = 2/5
- Decimal to percentage: Multiply by 100
  Example: 0.6 = 0.6 × 100 = 60%

**Finding Percentage of a Number**
To find x% of a number: Multiply the number by x/100
Example: 20% of 50 = (20/100) × 50 = 10

**Applications**
- Calculating discounts in shopping
- Finding profit and loss in business
- Calculating marks and grades
- Interest calculations

## Chapter 7: Basic Algebra

**What is Algebra?**
Algebra uses letters and symbols to represent unknown numbers.
These letters are called variables or unknowns.
Common variables: x, y, z, a, b, c

**Algebraic Expressions**

**Terms in Algebra**
- **Constant**: Numbers without variables (5, -3, 10)
- **Variable**: Letters representing unknowns (x, y, z)
- **Coefficient**: Number multiplying a variable (in 5x, coefficient is 5)
- **Like terms**: Terms with same variables (3x and 7x)
- **Unlike terms**: Terms with different variables (3x and 5y)

**Simplifying Expressions**
Combine like terms by adding or subtracting coefficients.
Example: 3x + 5x - 2x = (3 + 5 - 2)x = 6x

**Simple Equations**
Equation shows two expressions are equal using = sign.
Example: x + 5 = 12
To solve: x = 12 - 5 = 7
